In my workflow, CI/CD tools like Jenkins automate the build and testing of code. We package the app into Docker images using a Dockerfile, and then deploy these containers to Kubernetes clusters using deployment YAMLs. This ensures scalability, zero-downtime deployment, and faster delivery.

CI/CD pipeline is an automated process that helps build, test, and deploy code faster and more reliably. Iâ€™ve worked on CI/CD using Jenkins and Docker, where code commits triggered automatic builds and container deployments into test environments.
