Self-Introduction ðŸŒŸ
Hello, my name is Skand Tripathi.
I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in 2023 from PSIT, Kanpur, and have been working at Ericsson for the past 2.2 years (including internship). Out of this, I have 1.8 years of hands-on experience as a DevOps Engineer.

Currently, I am engaged with a major European telecom client, where I handle end-to-end DevOps processes â€” from infrastructure automation and cloud provisioning to CI/CD pipeline development and monitoring.

My core strengths include:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform

CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps

Strong command over Azure CLI, PowerShell, and Git

Iâ€™ve worked on optimizing deployment workflows, enhancing cloud infrastructure scalability, and enforcing DevOps best practices to ensure high system availability and performance.

If you'd like, Iâ€™d be happy to walk you through my current project and explain my responsibilities in more detail.

1. Real-Time Network Monitoring System â€“ Telecom Use Case
Project Overview:
At Ericsson, we developed a real-time network monitoring and management system for a leading European telecom operator, focused on enhancing the reliability and scalability of 5G infrastructure. The goal was to build a centralized cloud-native dashboard that aggregates live data from over 3,000+ network nodes, tracking key metrics such as signal strength, user traffic, and equipment health, while triggering automated alerts for early issue detection and resolution.

Team Structure:
This large-scale project was executed by a cross-functional team comprising front-end and back-end developers, network engineers, QA specialists, and DevOps engineers. The system utilized a microservices-based architecture to enable high availability, scalability, and modular development of services for data ingestion, analytics, and visualization.

My Role â€“ DevOps Engineer:
As part of the DevOps team, I was responsible for end-to-end infrastructure automation and deployment workflows, including:

Infrastructure Provisioning:
Automated deployment of scalable Azure infrastructure using Terraform, including VNet, Subnets, Azure Key Vault, VMs, Storage Accounts, and Azure SQL Databases.

CI/CD Implementation:
Designed and maintained Azure DevOps pipelines and GitHub Actions workflows to automate build, test, and deployment processes for over 20+ microservices, reducing release times by ~40%.

Version Control & Collaboration:
Used Git and GitHub for source control and code reviews, enabling seamless team collaboration and traceability across the development lifecycle.

Security & Traffic Management:
Configured Azure Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF) for secure ingress traffic management, load balancing, and SSL certificate-based encryption.

Monitoring & Incident Response:
Deployed comprehensive monitoring using Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights, resulting in a 30% improvement in incident detection time and significantly faster root cause analysis.

Performance Optimization & Support:
Worked closely with developers and network teams to debug environment issues, optimize container performance, and establish DevOps best practices, which improved system uptime to 99.95%+.
